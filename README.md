# 1. Introduction
Throughout the course of this project, I gained valuable insights on database management system and retrieval languages. In this opportunity, our group embarks on journey to implement a project to design database based on AirBnB dataset provided.

## 1.1. Project Objective
The objective of this project is to understand the basic process of data management and retrieval in real applications and organizations, which generally covers the following tasks and procedures: collecting, processing, storing and accessing data.

---

## 1.2. Project Background
For the purpose of this project, an industrial dataset was gathered from AirBnB platform which is one of famous lodging online platform. The dataset is obtained from website [http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) for Bangkok, Central Thailand, Thailand. 

From this dataset, few processes are involved such as knowing the inherent properties of the data, cleaning the dataset, generating derivative relations, storing data in both relational and non-relational database systems, and retrieving data so as to answer few samples of user queries.
